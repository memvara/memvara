# The adversarial test suite

This page is for anyone adding to or running the adversarial suite. The suite tries to break memvara, and it uses memvara the way an agent does: through the real MCP server process, the real hook scripts and a real store, rather than by calling library functions directly. The design and the reasons behind it are in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-25-adversarial-test-suite-design.md`.

The suite lives in two places:

- `tests/harness/` is support code, and it holds no tests.
- `tests/adversarial/` holds the tests. Every file there is named `test_adv_*.py`.

## Child processes

**Every child process the suite starts gets its environment from `harness.env.child_env(home)`.** That function does five things:

- It refuses the real home directory.
- It removes every `MEMVARA_`, `ANTHROPIC_`, `OPENAI_` and Claude Code variable.
- It points `PYTHONPATH` at this checkout.
- It selects the hashing embedder, with encryption and project detection off.
- It stops the hooks from starting their background daemon.

A test that builds its own environment for a child process is the kind of test that once overwrote a developer's real credentials, so do not write one.

**The suite must import the checkout it lives in.** In a git worktree, a stale editable install can make `import memvara` load another copy. `test_adv_env.py` then fails first and explains the fix. There are two ways to fix it:

- run with `PYTHONPATH` set to the checkout;
- create a virtual environment inside the worktree (the `local/` directory is ignored by git) and install the checkout into it in editable mode.
